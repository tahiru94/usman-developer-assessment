### Setup Steps
1. Create slack channel named `<candidate>-tech-asmt` and invite candidate and team to channel
1. Create new repo from template named `<candidate>-developer-assessment`
1. Sent the following slack messages in the channel


    ```
    /invite @GitHub
    ```

    ```
    /github subscribe Triad-Behavioral-Health/<candidate>-developer-assessment
    ```

    ```
    Hey <candidate>, Let me know when you are in here and I'll post all the relevant details and links
    ```
    
    ```
    Below is the repo you will need to complete the Assessment. You can find instructions in the Repo’s readmes

    Totally fine if you ask questions in here after hours. We all have our slack set up not to wake us up. Just expect slower responses times the further from work hours you message.

    https://github.com/Triad-Behavioral-Health/<candidate>-developer-assessment

    Good luck!
    ```

    ```
    /remind #<candidate>-tech-asmt "End of Assessment" in 5 days
    ```
